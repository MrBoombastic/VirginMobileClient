# VirginMobileClient

Fetching data from VirginMobile Polska using reverse-engineered API!

## How-to

1. Enter your login (phone number) and password in `config.json` file. Example config is in this repo.
2. Create empty `cookie.txt` file in the same directory.
3. Run the app. `info.txt` will contain the most important data and `info.json` will contain all fetched data.
4. Done. Enjoy!
